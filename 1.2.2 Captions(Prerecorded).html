    <p>
        Captions are visible text synchronized with spoken audio,
        so users who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can access the same information.
        <br>
        00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
        Hello, it's Eugenia again and this is the WCAG Documents project focused on web accessibility.
<br>
        00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
        In this video, I will talk about the WCAG criterion 1.2.2 Captions Pre-recorded.
<br>
        00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
        You can also read it online at accessibility.actumdigital.com where you will find more information.
<br>
        00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
        Let's get into it.
<br>
        00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
        The intent of this success criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the
        auditory information in pre-recorded, 
        <br>
        which means not live-streamed, synchronized media by providing captions.
<br>
        00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
        Who benefits from it? People who can adhere an audio content of a video can read synchronized captions to
        understand the content.
<br>
        00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
        People who have difficulties understanding the language of the audio track in a video can benefit from reading
        the caption in parallel.
<br>
        00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
        People in a sound-sensitive environment such as library, public transport, or at work can understand the media
        content without audio.
<br>
        00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
        People who want to hear and read the content at the same time to understand it better also benefit from
        captions.
<br>
        00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:18.000
        So what are the synchronized media? It is audio or video content synchronized with another format for presenting
        information such as video plus audio, video plus captions, or video plus audio descriptions.
<br>
        00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:32.000
        A note about captions. Subtitles and captions are often inaccurately considered the same thing, but there are
        some differences.
<br>
        00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
        Subtitles convey the content of the spoken dialogue only. The purpose is to translate spoken audio into a
        language that viewer understands.
<br>
        00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
        Captions not only include the dialogue but also identify who is speaking, meaningful sound effects, and
        non-speech information conveyed through sound.
<br>
        00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.000
        If users turn off the sound of a video, they must not miss any important audio content and captions. There are
        two types of captions, open and closed.
<br>
        00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
        Open captions are part of the video and cannot be turned off.
<br>
        00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
        Users have no option to change their color, size, position, or other preferences that are essential for some
        people.
<br>
        00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
        Closed captions can be turned on and off by the viewer, usually with the possibility to change their color,
        size, position, and other styles.
<br>
        00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.000
        This success criterion has the following exceptions. Captions are not needed when the synchronized media itself
        is the alternative.
<br>
        00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
        For instance, if text information on a page has also a synchronized media presentation that offers the same
        information as the text, 
        <br>
        this media presentation does not have to have captions.
<br>
        00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
        Let's take a look at some examples.
<br>
        00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:03.000
        The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility. Captions.
<br>
        00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
        A video about the life of pigs picturing a pig running over grass while squealing.
<br>
        00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
        The video has captions so people relying on captions can understand that pig is squealing.
<br>
        00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
        The following example shows the incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.
<br>
        00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
        Missing captions. A video picturing a dialogue between two people.
<br>
        00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
        The dialogue is an essential part of the video and because there are no available captions, users who rely on
        captions completely miss important auditory information.
<br>
        00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
        And that was all for this video. Thank you for watching and see you in the next one. Have a nice day!
