Hello, it's Eugenia again and this is the WCAG Documents project focused on web accessibility.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this video, I will talk about the WCAG criterion 1.2.2 Captions Pre-recorded.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You can also read it online at accessibility.actumdigital.com where you will find more information.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's get into it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The intent of this success criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the auditory information in pre-recorded, which means not live-streamed, synchronized media by providing captions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Who benefits from it? People who can adhere an audio content of a video can read synchronized captions to understand the content.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
People who have difficulties understanding the language of the audio track in a video can benefit from reading the caption in parallel.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
People in a sound-sensitive environment such as library, public transport, or at work can understand the media content without audio.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
People who want to hear and read the content at the same time to understand it better also benefit from captions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So what are the synchronized media? It is audio or video content synchronized with another format for presenting information such as video plus audio, video plus captions, or video plus audio descriptions.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:32.000
A note about captions. Subtitles and captions are often inaccurately considered the same thing, but there are some differences.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Subtitles convey the content of the spoken dialogue only. The purpose is to translate spoken audio into a language that viewer understands.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Captions not only include the dialogue but also identify who is speaking, meaningful sound effects, and non-speech information conveyed through sound.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If users turn off the sound of a video, they must not miss any important audio content and captions. There are two types of captions, open and closed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Open captions are part of the video and cannot be turned off.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Users have no option to change their color, size, position, or other preferences that are essential for some people.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Closed captions can be turned on and off by the viewer, usually with the possibility to change their color, size, position, and other styles.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This success criterion has the following exceptions. Captions are not needed when the synchronized media itself is the alternative.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
For instance, if text information on a page has also a synchronized media presentation that offers the same information as the text, this media presentation does not have to have captions.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Let's take a look at some examples.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility. Captions.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
A video about the life of pigs picturing a pig running over grass while squealing.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The video has captions so people relying on captions can understand that pig is squealing.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The following example shows the incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Missing captions. A video picturing a dialogue between two people.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The dialogue is an essential part of the video and because there are no available captions, users who rely on captions completely miss important auditory information.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And that was all for this video. Thank you for watching and see you in the next one. Have a nice day!
